Lane Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

## Description
After taking an Introduciton to AI class, I wanted to explore Convolution Neural Networks, a topic we only lightly covered in the course. 
Currently I am fine tuning the model to get a label to the point where the image of the line is as clear as possible. The eventual goal of 
the project is to use the model to create a line following RC car using only a camera for input
